# Project 1 Proposal

### Project idea 1: Mapping market sizes of US football teams

This project will compare the market sizes of American football teams by comparing the population of the area around them.

Two data sets will be needed
* US population
* Location of all 32 football teams

The first set of data can be found at this ArcGIS hub link: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/48f9af87daa241c4b267c5931ad3b226_0 this includes US population broken into counties.

The second set will need to be Geo-referenced by creating point features for all 32 teams based on the location of their stadium.

The goal of this project will be to create a map of the "range" of each team, by determining the area that each team occupies, then plotting the population in each area
to determine the relative market size of each team.

Analysis will be done using Qgis.

The output will be a map showing the size of each team's reach and popualtion inside each area.

### Project idea 2: World Climate
###### This is my "backup plan"

The goal of this project will be to create a map of climate around the world

My idea comes from this ArcGIS story map: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/61a5d4e9494f46c2b520a984b2398f3b%20

The first item needed will be a map of the world. This can be found basically anyehere, but here is an ArcGIS hub link for an easy one: 
https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a21fdb46d23e4ef896f31475217cbb08_1

Then I would like to display temperature, precipitation, and climate for the world, in three subsequent maps.

This will be done through additional research, and will be pulled from additional sources I can find displaying these three regions, or by makign the polygons myself.

The output will be three maps that show the relationship between precipitation, temperature, and subsiquent climate.
