### Mapping change in California wildfires over time

The goal of this project is to display the increase in wildfire change over the past 60 years.

Data was aquired from the FARP initiative open data group, website can be found [here](https://egis.fire.ca.gov/arcgis/rest/services/FRAP/FirePerimeters/MapServer)

Data sets are shown in decades with dates, sizes, locations, and other information about recorded wildfires.
