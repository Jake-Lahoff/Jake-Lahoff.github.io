# Hurricane Harvey

---
Hurricane Harvey was a category 4 hurricane that made landfall in Texas on August 25th, 2017. The hurricane brought with it massive flooding that devistated Texas and Louisiana. This was particurarily devistating in the area in and arround around Houston, Texas. Nearly 50% of the total rainfall from the hurricane fell in the area around Houston, with peak rainfall up to 60 inches over the corse of the storm. The rain accumulated in Texas was so high, the National Weather Service had to add 2 new colors to its rain index. Overall, the storm delt an estimated $125 billion in damage, and claimed the lives of 68 people.

The goal of my project is to quantify the effects of the flooding, and find out how it may have impacted the population in Houston.

## Step 1: Population

The first step was to gather population data. I used tidycensus through Rstudio to collect this data from the American Community Survey.
